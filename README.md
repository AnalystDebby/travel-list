# Travel-List

The travel-list app serves as a convenient tool for users to create itemized packing lists for their trips. It mimics a traditional to-do list format, allowing users to easily add, remove, and check off items as they pack. By organizing items systematically, the app helps users stay organized and ensures they don't forget any essential items while preparing for their journeys.
